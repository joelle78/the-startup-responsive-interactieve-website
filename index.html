                            As a Senior Designer at Verve

                        <p>
                            You are an experienced brand designer that translates the client's goals into strategic design concepts that connect with their audiences and drive their brand forward. Thanks to your knowledge and experience in digital branding and research, you’ll empower your colleagues in design, strategy, and digital design to create their very best work. You'll work at least three days at one of our studios in Amsterdam or The Hague.
                        </p>

                    <div>
                        <p>
                            You'll create brand identities rooted in brand strategy. You don't believe that a brand is its logo. You create holistic brand systems that live across and adapt to different kinds of media. You pitch and present to clients, you share creative insights in inspiring keynotes. You’re a creator and confident speaker, with a vision for the future of branding, tech, culture, and design. You evoke a sense of trust and calm within your team and quickly translate trends in the world into great strategic ideas and striking visuals. With your positive and proactive attitude, you turn every project into collective success.
